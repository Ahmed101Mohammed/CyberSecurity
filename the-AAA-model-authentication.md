# The AAA Model: Authentication
## 1st A of AAA model: Authentication
- Which is the process of providing you are who you say you are .
- When you claim you are someone, that's called identification.
- When you prove it, that's authentication.
- Authentication requires proof in one of three forms:
  - Something you know: like a password.
  - Something you have: like a key fob.
  - Something you are: biometrics.
- When combined more than one **different** form of authontication, it's called: multifactor authentication.

## Multifactor Authentication
- Makes it really hard to authenticate as someonelse -- impersonating them.

## 2FA => 2 Factor Authentication
- Used by Google, Facebook, Banks sites.
- Like a compination of your password, and a secret number send to you phone by SMS.

## NIST (National Institute of Standarsds & Technology)
- They stated that 2FA with SMS should be deprecated immediately due to the fact that SMS messages can be intercepted or redirected.
- They recommended other options like Google authenticator or even certain USB dongles.
