- It requires to know: - Who the hacker are. - Who the attackers are. -What their motiviations are. -Where our vulerabilities lie. - How protected we actually are.

## Cyberspace: 
- Is the digital world where all online interactions happen. It's where you chat, work, learn, and even face cyber threats!

## Penetration testers tasks:

## How to treate with attacks:
- Treating each attack as an isolated incident is a huge mistake.
- There needs to be greater intelligence, correlated attacks, to previouse attacks. both within a company and between companies.

- The hackers are doing fra more sharing and collaborating than the good guys.
