# What is the secure program?
- It seems to be a coverall for anything that's badly written. If it is badly written it's not the secure program.
- Badly written code, may not be directly insecure, it can be insecure through the fragility of the program.
- The fragile program is an insecure one.
- The secure program is a robust one, but the robust program it's not a condition to be secure.

## Privilege
- It's the right you have to do something on the program, each user has some level of privilege that makes the app secure because the privilege determines user accessibility.

## protection domain
- All objects to which the process has access, and the type of access the process has. In simpler words: it's every resource that can the program access and everything that it can do when it does those accesses.
- To make a secure program, make its protection domains as limited as possible for its task, because the damage will be less.
