# General Phylosophy for secure programming
## Program defensively
- What could someone deliberately do to compromise your program or the system it runs on?
- What could someone unintentionally do to compromise your program or the system it runs on?
- Understand the environment in which your program will be used (*Note*: If you don't know it, think of as many possible environments as you can (all of them).)
- Understand the procedures under which people will use your program (always cause a problem if some thing is wrong).

*** If your code is secure, it should be a robust code, but if it is robust, it's not should be secure. ***
