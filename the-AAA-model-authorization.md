# The AAA Model: Authorization
## 2nd A of AAA model: Authorization
- Means that based on teh user's credentials, we let hem do certain things and not others.
- This is tied into the principle of least privilege, which states users and even devices, programs, and processes should be granted enough permissions to do their required functions and not a single drop more.
- Any authorization beyond normal job functions opens the door for either accidental or malicious violations of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
